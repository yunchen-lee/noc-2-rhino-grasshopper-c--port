*Some paths created by my 3D robot¬†ant.*

Imagine a little robot ant that move randomly in space‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat‚Äôs what a random walker is! In this post, I‚Äôll introduce how to build a random walker in Rhino and Grasshopper using C#, and also explore different versions of random walkers and how they behave.

### 2D Random¬†Walker

*Traditional 2D Random Walker in Grasshopper.*

I started with the traditional 2D random walker, ported from p5.js to C#. In Grasshopper, we write our scroipt in a C# component, and by triggering the component at a fixed time interval, we can see the walker‚Äôs path evolve over time (similar to the `draw()` function in p5.js).

*Activate the random walker with a¬†trigger.*

To draw the path, every step of the walker is stored as a point (using Rhino‚Äôs `Point3d` object). This gives us a continuous, organic line path that mimics a natural, wandering path.

### A Little Adjustment: Jump-Step Walker

![Pasted 2025-03-29-16-46-53 3.png](./3D%20Random%20Walker%20in%20Grasshopper%20C#-assets/Pasted%202025-03-29-16-46-53%203.png)

A traditional 4-Step Walker creates a continuous path. Now, let‚Äôs experiment with a different rule in the `step()` function to generate unpredictable patterns.¬†

In this example, I implemented a Jump-Step Walker with eight possible steps. The jump steps produce a more dynamic, leap-like digital footprint.¬†

![Pasted 2025-03-29-16-46-53 4.png](./3D%20Random%20Walker%20in%20Grasshopper%20C#-assets/Pasted%202025-03-29-16-46-53%204.png)

Here‚Äôs a snippet of the jump-step logic:

```
public void step(){
      int choice = (int) Math.Floor(rnd.NextDouble()*8);
      if (choice == 0) px++;
      else if(choice == 1) px--;
      else if(choice == 2) py++;
      else if(choice == 3) py--;
      else if(choice == 4) px-=2;
      else if(choice == 5) px+=2;
      else if(choice == 6) py-=2;
      else py+=2;

      pts_list.Add(new Point3d(px, py, 0));
  }
```

### 3D Random¬†Walker

To take the concept further, the `Walker` object can be extended into 3D by adding a new property for the z-coordinate (`pz`). Now, the walker is no longer limited to a flate plane‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit can move up and down as well as side to side. This results in cool, three-dimensional paths in space.

*3D Random Walker*

Here‚Äôs how the 3D walker works:

```
class Walker{
    public int px;
    public int py;
    public int pz;
    public List<Point3d> pts_list;
    Random rnd;

    public Walker(){
        px = 0;
        py = 0;
        pz = 0;
        pts_list = new List<Point3d>();
        rnd = new Random();
    }

    public void step(){
        int choice = (int) Math.Floor(rnd.NextDouble()*6);
        if (choice == 0) px++;
        else if(choice == 1) px--;
        else if(choice == 2) py++;
        else if(choice == 3) py--;
        else if(choice == 4) pz++;
        else pz--;

        pts_list.Add(new Point3d(px, py, pz));
    }
```

## What‚Äôs the Next¬†Step?

- **Mimic Animal Tracks:** Try to simulate the paths of different animals for more organic patterns.

- **Unique Footprints:** Experiment with custom rules to generate one-of-a-kind footprints.
